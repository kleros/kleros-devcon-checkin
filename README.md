# Kleros booth check-in · Devcon VIII Mumbai

Visitors scan the booth QR, check in on their phone, confirm their Kleros blog subscription, and get a personalised "Picked for you" screen with their merch tier. More steps unlock better merch: Teal for checking in, Purple for joining the Kleros Telegram and following Kleros on X and LinkedIn, Gold for also getting the Kleros 101 quiz right. Staff hand over merch by the colour on the screen. Every check-in lands in a Google Sheet, matched to a Kleros use case with a priority and a suggested next step.

- **Site:** static HTML/JS in `site/`, no build step. Goes live at **https://devcon.kleros.io** (same URL every Devcon; the printed QR codes point there).
- **Game:** **https://devcon.kleros.io/curate/** (`site/curate/`) is a 90-second Kleros Curate game and a second way up the same merch ladder: pick an app and help it fix its list. Players scan their Devcon badge for 2 counted tries for the whole event (not per day); the staff merch desk is at **/staff/**. Static like the rest and no change to the check-in backend: badge tries, newsletter contacts and the desk go to the game owner's own sheet script ([`apps-script/staff-desk/`](apps-script/staff-desk/README.md)). See [Curate game (/curate)](#curate-game-curate).
- **Backend:** Google Apps Script web app in `apps-script/`, writing to a Google Sheet in the weiwei@kleros.io Drive.
- **Preview:** https://kleros-devcon.pages.dev (temporary copy on Wei Wei's Cloudflare account, for review only).

## Start here (devs)

Short version: [`docs/DEPLOY.md`](docs/DEPLOY.md). `bash scripts/package.sh` builds `dist/kleros-devcon-deploy.zip` (site folder for Netlify, the backend as one file, the deploy guide) for handing over without the repo.

1. **Deploy the site** on Kleros's Netlify, like ai.kleros.io. `netlify.toml` publishes `site/` as is; connect this repo, or drag `site/` into *Deploy manually*.
2. **Domain:** add `devcon.kleros.io` to the Netlify site, and a CNAME `devcon` → `<site-name>.netlify.app` in Cloudflare (kleros.io's DNS lives there).
3. **Blog gate webhooks:** run `ghostWebhookSetup`, then a Ghost admin adds two webhooks pointing at the URL it logs (see [Blog confirmation gate](#blog-confirmation-gate)). No Ghost API key is needed. **Until then nobody can finish checking in.**
4. **Telegram bot:** add the @KlerosDevconBot token and run `telegramSetup` (see [Merch tiers and the Telegram bot](#merch-tiers-and-the-telegram-bot)). **Until then nobody can reach Purple or Gold.**

## Repo layout

| `apps-script/staff-desk/` | The game owner's sheet script: badge tries, contacts, Switches and the desk; separate from the check-in backend ([setup](apps-script/staff-desk/README.md)) |
| `site/_headers`, `site/robots.txt` | No-cache for `config.js`/`matching.js`/`quiz.js` and the `site/curate/` scripts, dashboard kept out of search engines |

| `docs/RESEARCH_AGENT.md` | Playbook for the agents that research leads |
| `docs/telegram-bot-avatar.png` | @KlerosDevconBot's profile picture (the gold Kleros Juror seal from the tattoo sheet) |

Run locally: `python3 -m http.server -d site 8000`. Note `config.js` points at the **live** backend; set `endpoint: ''` for demo mode (check-ins stay on the device, no emails sent). The game is at http://localhost:8000/curate/: it loads the same `config.js` (for the merch names and pictures) but never posts to its backend. With `server.endpoint` empty it runs per phone and posts nothing; with it set, it posts to the booth sheet script only.

## How a check-in works

1. **Form.** Name, company, role, job level, **email** (required), optional Telegram/LinkedIn/X, interests (four focus cards, "Others" with free text, extra chips), optional free text, and an optional "Subscribe me to the Kleros blog" box. (No "Book a call": people who want a follow-up use the Connect page, below.)
2. **Saved.** The check-in is queued on the phone and posted to the backend; it leaves the queue only when the backend confirms the save (retries are safe, the backend dedupes on a client id). `keepalive` lets it finish if the visitor closes the page.
3. **Blog sign-up (only if they ticked the box).** The page asks Ghost (blog.kleros.io) to send its own "Complete your sign up" email. Ghost only creates the subscriber once they tap *Confirm signup*. Visitors who leave the box unticked skip steps 3–4 and go straight to the final screen.
4. **Confirm your email.** The page polls the backend every 4 s (immediately when the visitor returns from their mail app). Ghost's webhook marks **Newsletter = Confirmed** in the Sheet (*Yes* = ticked, not confirmed yet; *No* = box left unticked). With the wait off, the screen still stays up 15 s before moving on.
5. **Final screen.** Only then: a ticket in their tier's colour (reward, name, code and a ticking clock, so a screenshot is easy to spot), the level-up steps, Kleros 101, a **Play Curate** card that opens the game at `/curate/` (hidden on a `?kiosk=1` tablet), then "Picked for you": their best-fit Kleros area (with why, and their own words quoted back), another area they picked, a tip for their role, the other headline areas, the Community Hubs card and links. All links go to docs.kleros.io, ai.kleros.io or the Kleros Telegram (Booth Guidelines: no token pages).
6. **Level up.** Join the Kleros Telegram (checked by @KlerosDevconBot), tap Follow on X and LinkedIn (counted on tap) → Purple. Plus all three Kleros 101 questions right → Gold. A wrong answer is crossed out with the reason, and they pick again.
7. **One check-in per person.** Reopening the page on the same phone shows the same screen, tier and progress. A second check-in with an email (or Telegram account) that already reached the final screen shows **Already claimed** instead of a tier. "Check in someone else" only exists on a staff tablet opened with `?kiosk=1` (Teal only: the tablet resets after a few seconds).

Staff just look at the colour; nothing to scan. The dashboard's merch desk is optional; it re-checks the confirmation with Ghost and refuses "Already claimed" check-ins.

## Backend (Apps Script)

Live project: **Kleros Devcon 2026 · Booth Leads Backend** (standalone, owned by weiwei@kleros.io), deployed as a web app (*Execute as: Me*, *Access: Anyone*). Its `/exec` URL is in `site/config.js`. The Sheet is **Kleros Devcon 2026 · Booth Leads Database**, in Drive › Devcon 2026 -Master Reference › Kleros Booth Check-in · Devcon 2026.

| Request | What it does |
|---|---|
| `POST {check-in}` | Saves a check-in (no key; malformed requests are rejected) |
| `POST {action:'verify', id[, steps, tg]}` | Polled by the page: blog subscription confirmed? Then the merch tier, Telegram state and "Already claimed". Also records the page's steps (`{x, linkedin, quiz, wrong}`); `tg: true` makes it read the bot's new messages |
| `POST {action:'enrich', key, ticket, agent, fields}` | Research agents write the Background research columns, logged in *Agent log* |
| `GET ?key=K` | All leads (dashboard) |
| `GET ?key=K&action=merch&id=ID&value=true` | Record merch given (only for confirmed subscribers) |
| `GET ?key=K&action=queue[&limit=N]` | Leads waiting for research |

Guards use `require_(condition, error)`; `respond_` turns a failed one into `{ ok: false, error }`.

**Script properties:** `ADMIN_KEY` (dashboard/agent key; Sheet menu *Kleros › Show dashboard / agent key*), `SHEET_ID`, `GHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (made by `ghostWebhookSetup`), `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, optional `TELEGRAM_GROUP` (default `@kleros`) and `SITE_URL` (default `https://devcon.kleros.io`). `TELEGRAM_OFFSET` is managed by the code.

**Changing the backend:** edit `apps-script/Code.gs` (and `site/matching.js` for matching), then

```bash
bash scripts/apps-script-bundle.sh | pbcopy
```

paste over everything in the editor, save, then *Deploy › Manage deployments › ✏️ › Version: New version › Deploy* (same URL). Menu actions use the saved code straight away; the web app only changes on a new version. Current live version: **18** (blog gate via Ghost webhooks with an on/off switch and a webhook call log; merch tier columns already added with `addMerchTierColumns`).

**From scratch:** create a standalone project at script.google.com while signed in as the Kleros account, paste the bundle, set `FOLDER_ID` in `Code.gs`, run `setup` (it creates and names the Sheet in that folder), approve permissions, deploy as a web app as above, and put the `/exec` URL in `site/config.js`.

### Blog confirmation gate

The page signs visitors up through Ghost's public members API, and Ghost emails them a link. Ghost creates a member only after they tap it, so "Ghost added this member" means "confirmed". Ghost tells the backend through webhooks; the backend holds no Ghost key and never calls Ghost.

1. Apps Script editor: run `ghostWebhookSetup`. It saves `GHOST_WEBHOOK_SECRET` and logs the target URL (the web app URL plus `?hook=ghost&secret=…`). Send that URL to the Ghost admin privately: it contains the secret.
2. Ghost admin › Settings › Integrations › **Add custom integration** ("Devcon booth") › **Add webhook**, twice, both with that target URL:
   - `Member added`: a new subscriber tapped *Confirm signup*.
   - `Member edited`: an existing subscriber gets a sign-in email instead; opening the blog from it updates their "last seen", which Ghost reports as an edit (at most once a day per member).
3. Check in on a phone with a fresh email, tap the link in the blog email, and the final screen appears within seconds.

Why a secret in the URL: Apps Script can't read Ghost's `X-Ghost-Signature` header. The backend keeps an email only when it matches a check-in (as *Newsletter = Confirmed*); any other member's email sits in the script cache for 6 hours and is never stored. Ghost may show the deliveries as failed, because Apps Script answers POSTs with a redirect; the backend still gets them. **Not confirming?** Run `ghostWebhookStatus` in the editor: it logs the last 10 webhook calls (parameter names and lengths, no secrets or emails). `params: ["hook"]` with `givenLength: 0` means the Target URL in Ghost lost its `&secret=…` part.

**Switch (live setting: OFF for Devcon, decided 27 Oct: the blog box is optional, so the booth never waits).** Run `blogGateOff` in the editor and the booth stops waiting: visitors reach the final screen and merch right after checking in, and the blog card asks them to tap the link in Ghost's email. Only this site's waiting step changes. Ghost still emails them and subscribes them only once they tap the link (Kleros's double opt-in is untouched), and a webhook confirmation still sets *Newsletter* to `Confirmed`. `blogGateOn` restores the wait. `ghostWebhookStatus` shows which way it is set.

Strict on purpose: until `ghostWebhookSetup` has run, visitors wait on "Confirm your email" and see "Confirmation check is offline. Please ask the Kleros team." Nobody is waved through. An existing subscriber who already opened the blog that day gets no new event; set their row's *Newsletter* to `Confirmed` in the Sheet to let them through.

### Connect with the Kleros team (hot leads)

A quiet button at the bottom of the check-in page and of the ticket opens `connect.html` (also at `/connect`). It is for people who want a real follow-up, not merch: name, company, email, what they want to talk about (using Kleros in their product, a pilot, partnership, speaking/research/media, other), what they are building, timing, how to reach them, and who they talked to at the booth. It is pre-filled when they checked in on the same phone, and offline-safe like the check-in.

The backend (`POST {action:'connect', rid, …}`) adds one row to the **Hot leads** tab (deduped on `rid`), with empty *Follow-up owner*, *Status* (starts as New) and *Team notes* for the team. If the same email checked in, that Leads row gets *Wants call = Yes* and fresh matching, so it shows as Hot everywhere and the Dashboard counts it.

### Merch tiers and the Telegram bot

| Tier | Needs | Checked how | Merch (stock) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Everyone | nothing | | Stickers, metallic tattoos (50 A5 sheets) |
| Teal | Check-in (if they ticked the blog box while the wait is on: a confirmed email) | Ghost webhooks (above) | Flip-flops (200) |
| Purple | + joined the Kleros Telegram group, tapped Follow on X and on LinkedIn | Telegram: @KlerosDevconBot. X and LinkedIn: counted on tap (checking needs paid APIs) | Copper bottle (100) or gamcha (100) |
| Gold | + all three Kleros 101 questions right | On the page (a wrong pick explains why; they pick again until right) | Kurta (100) |

One item per person, from their tier. PoH charms (50) and PoH tees (50) are left out for now; the 28 named kurtas are the team's. Rewards and pictures live in `site/config.js` (`merch`), the questions in `site/quiz.js`.

Purple and Gold are easy to reach (the quiz can't be failed), so most visitors will aim for them. Split the stock per day (about 25 kurtas and 50 Purple items a day over the four days) and give the tier below when today's runs out.

**One item per person, across both routes.** The check-in and the [Curate game](#curate-game-curate) climb the same ladder and share the same stock. A visitor gets one item per Devcon badge: staff scan the badge at `/staff/` for either route (game tier from the badge list, check-in tier from the K- ticket's colour). PoH tees and charms can stand in for a tier that runs out: `substitutes` in `site/curate/settings.js` swaps that tier's reward text and pictures in the game (see the stock runbook below).

**Telegram check.** The page links to `t.me/KlerosDevconBot?start=<client id>`. The visitor taps Start; the backend reads the bot's messages (`getUpdates`) whenever a waiting page polls and every minute from a trigger, asks Telegram whether that account is in the group (`getChatMember`), saves the result and replies in the chat (with a "Join the Kleros group" button if they aren't in yet). One Telegram account unlocks one check-in.

Setup, once:

1. **Token.** In Telegram, @BotFather › `/mybots` › KlerosDevconBot › *API Token*. Apps Script › Project settings › Script properties: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` = the token. Never paste it anywhere else.
2. **Group.** The bot is already in t.me/kleros as a member (added 26 Oct 2026). Telegram only guarantees member lookups to admins.
3. Run `telegramSetup` in the editor: it checks the token, tests a member lookup, and installs the every-minute trigger. If it logs "Member lookups: NOT working", a group admin who can add admins makes @KlerosDevconBot an administrator with no permissions. As an admin the bot also receives the group's messages; the backend skips them and stores nothing. After Devcon, run `telegramStop`.

Bot profile (name, description, picture `docs/telegram-bot-avatar.png`) is set in @BotFather.

**Already claimed.** The first check-in of an email to reach the final screen gets the merch (Sheet: *Claim = Claimed*). A later check-in with the same email, from another phone or browser, gets *Already claimed* and no tier; so does a check-in whose Telegram account already unlocked another one. Reopening the page on the same phone is the same check-in, so a visitor who confirms now and comes back for merch later keeps their tier.

### Curate game (/curate)

https://devcon.kleros.io/curate/ teaches Kleros Curate by doing it, and is a second way up the merch ladder. Visitors reach it from the **Play Curate** card on their final screen or from its own QR poster. It is plain static files in `site/curate/`, sharing `/config.js` (merch names and pictures) and `/assets/` with the check-in.

**Its own page.** `/curate/` is a standalone game, not the check-in with a game on top: no check-in header, gold frame, starfield, icosahedrons or tagline. The full-height title screen (Kleros colours) keeps its words short: *Help an app, get rewarded.*, *Each entry is right, or has one error. Spot the errors in 90 s.*, the hint row *← Wrong* · *Correct →*, and **Pick an app** above three big cards. Each card has a picture (a photo, a flag, painted token logos), the app's name, one line on what it needs and *10 entries · 90 s*. Tapping a card opens that app's intro (below). Under the cards sit the prize strip (the four merch tiers as chips) and the tries line (*Your Devcon badge gives 2 tries for merch.*); the footer holds *How it works* (a sheet ending with the photo credits) and *Booth check-in*; the fine print is one line, *A game. Photos: Wikimedia Commons. Privacy* (the game's own notice). The intro, play, Results and ticket screens use the same frame.

**The intro.** One screen between the app card and the round, few words: *Spot the error, if there is one.*, the app's rule in one line (*Photo, name, city and country must all match.*), then two example entries from that app's own cards. A correct one (*Correct →*, *All four match.*: the Eiffel Tower, Paris, France) and a wrong one with the wrong part marked in red and a one-line reason (*← Wrong*: Eiffel Tower in Marseille, *The Eiffel Tower is in Paris, not Marseille.*). Countries uses India / New Delhi / `.in` against India with Mumbai as capital; Tokens uses Bitcoin / `bitcoin.org` against a giveaway site. The correct example is never dealt in a round. Under them, the start area: **Start** (or **Scan your badge**, below), *Play for fun* and *Pick another app*. One tap starts. The intro replaces the old practice card.

**How to play.** Three apps (all fictional) show lists to their users, and fakers try to sneak fakes in. Each card on the title screen is one app with one list, in the spirit of the old Curate game. The player says whether each entry is **Wrong** or **Correct**. Every entry has **4 parts**: the picture and three lines. Curate's own words (challenge, deposit, jurors and the like) appear only in *How it works*, never on the play screen.

| App (card) | Its need | Each entry | Picture |
|---|---|---|---|
| Travel guide app (Sightseeing) | needs real sights on its map | Photo, name, city, country | A real photo from Wikimedia Commons: 39 photos, 24 world landmarks, 6 Mumbai sights and 9 more from across India (the Golden Temple, Hawa Mahal, Qutub Minar, India Gate and others) |
| Atlas app for schools (Countries) | needs the right flags and capitals | Flag, country, capital, web domain (`.it`, `.jp`, `.ch`) | The real flag, flat |
| Crypto exchange app (Tokens) | needs only real tokens in its listing | Logo, name, ticker, website | A flat logo coin painted in the token's brand colour (no downloaded logos); the title card shows Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDC |

v6 roughly doubles the lists: 39 real and 33 fake sights, 41 real and 26 fake countries (The Gambia left on 2 Nov: players read its *The* as the error), 24 real and 19 fake tokens (`node scripts/curate-check.js` prints the current counts under *Content*). The tokens are easy, famous ones (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, USDC, Dogecoin, Solana, XRP, Litecoin, Stellar, Polkadot, Arbitrum, Optimism, Gnosis, NEAR and the like, plus Kleros PNK), with no prices and no investment talk; every official website was re-checked, and websites are plain text, never links. In a fake, exactly one of the four parts is wrong: the Taj Mahal in the wrong city, Austria with the web domain `.au` (it is `.at`), Ethereum listed as `ETC` (that is Ethereum Classic), a lookalike website such as `etherium.org`, or a picture of another sight or token under this name. Each fake carries its fix and a why of 48 characters or fewer, which is the line the red flash shows. After Start, the app's mission shows for a moment, then the Go banner names the try: *Try 1 of 2 · Go!*, *Try 2 of 2 · Go!*, or *Just for fun · Go!* once both are used.

- One **round** is 90 s and 10 entries, 5 of them fake. The cards are from the app you picked. There is no per-entry countdown: an entry waits until you decide it. When the clock runs out the round ends, and the card on screen is not counted either way.
- Swipe right (or *✓ Correct*) when the entry is right.
- Swipe left (or *✗ Wrong*) when something in it is wrong. The card springs back to the centre in **pick mode**: *What’s wrong? Tap it.* (*What’s wrong? Press 1–4.* from the keyboard), with its 4 parts outlined and numbered 1–4. Tap the wrong part to decide; *Cancel* (or Esc) goes back without deciding. Swiping is off while picking. Outside pick mode, tapping a part does nothing.
- **The flash.** Every decision gets a full-screen answer, like in a game, instead of the old stamps, verdict words, juror dots and toasts. Green with a big ✓ **CORRECT** and *+100* for every right answer: a real entry marked Correct, or a fake marked Wrong with the wrong part tapped, with a small line naming it (*You spotted the city*). A softer green ✓ **CORRECT**, also *+100*, when the fake was caught but another part was tapped, and one line with the answer (*The wrong part was the city: Agra.*). Red with a big ✗ **WRONG** and one short reason, with no points, when a fake was marked Correct or a real entry Wrong (*The Taj Mahal is in Agra.*, *This one was real.*): a mistake's 10 points are no reward, so the flash doesn't show them and the score adds them without a bump. A tier unlock (*Teal unlocked*) shows inside the same flash. The bad flash stays up longer than the good one; a tap or any key skips it, and **the round clock is paused while it shows**. Reduced motion drops the scale-in and keeps the colour and the words.
- **A calm play screen.** During a round the screen shows only the time ring, the score, the progress (*3/10*), the pause button, the card and the two buttons. The card is the picture and its three lines, nothing else (no status chip, no footer). The streak pips, the merch meter, Trust, the client row and the policy line are gone from play; the policy line is the intro's rule, and Trust appears only on Results.
- No practice card: the intro shows the rule and the two examples, and pick mode asks for the wrong part in the round. Every round is 90 s: there is no *More time* option any more, and speed doesn't score.
- Keyboard: ← or A is Wrong, → or D is Correct, then 1–4 picks the part; Esc cancels a pick (or pauses), P pauses.

| Outcome | Points |
|---|---|
| Fake marked Wrong | +100, whichever part you tapped (the part only teaches: it changes the flash's line, not the points) |
| Real entry marked Correct | +100 |
| Real entry marked Wrong | +10 (Trust −5) |
| Fake marked Correct | +10 (Trust −15) |
| Left undecided when time runs out | 0 |
| Effort (2 Nov) | The score never drops below 10 per entry decided (`points.effort`): a full round scores at least 100, never 0. Since 3 Nov a wrong answer scores those 10 itself, so the floor only matters for a retune with penalties. 100 is well under Teal, so effort alone wins no merch |

There is no time bonus, streak bonus or bonus for the part: the score comes from the answers only, so a perfect round (all 10 right) scores 1,000 at any pace, as long as all 10 entries are decided within the 90 s. Trust (the app's users' trust in its list) only drives the Results headline; it never ends a round. No answer takes points away, so the score never goes down during a round.

**Results.** A 3D medal in the earned tier's colour (Everyone lilac, Teal, Purple, Gold) spins slowly at the top of Results: a lit metal coin with a reeded rim and the Kleros mark. It is a flat 2D medal with `?lite=1` or without WebGL, and holds still with reduced motion. Below it, short lines only: the score, a headline by how much Trust the list kept (*Great job*, *Not bad* or *Too many fakes got in*), *8 of 10 right*, one line on what happened to the list (*No wrong entry got through.* or *2 wrong entries got through.*; none for a round cut short with few cards seen), a bar from 0 to Gold, the maximum, with a marker at the score (three segments, to Teal, to Purple and to Gold, in the colours reached; the thresholds under it), the tier line and the tries line (*Try 1 of 2 · 1 try left* or *Try 2 of 2 · Both tries used*). In badge mode a save line follows the score to the badge list (*Saving your score…*, *Not saved yet. Trying again…*); *Show my merch ticket* waits for it. Then *Show my merch ticket* (*Unlock my merch ticket* when the contact step is still to do), *Play again* (back to the intro; *Play for fun* once both tries are used) and *Try another app*, which goes back to the title screen. Mistakes fold into *What you missed (n)*.

**A round just for fun** says plainly what the score reached and why it wins nothing: the tier line is *Your score reached Purple, but this round wins no merch.* (or *This round wins no merch.* under Teal), and the line under it says why and what to do: *Both tries used. Your Teal ticket still counts.* (or *Both tries used.* with no ticket: no new tries come on a later day), *This badge already got its merch.*, *No badge scanned. Scan it next round to play for merch.*, *Merch is paused right now. Ask at the booth.*, *We couldn’t reach the merch list, so this round was for fun.* or *You picked Play for fun. Tap Start next time to play for merch.* The medal shows the Everyone colour, so nothing looks won.

**Photos and credits.** The Sightseeing photos are in `site/curate/img/`: Wikimedia Commons files under CC0, public domain, CC BY or CC BY-SA, resized to 640 px wide and 60 KB or less (about 2.1 MB in all; ordinary cacheable files, unlike the no-cache scripts). `site/curate/credits.js` holds each file's subject, author, licence and Commons page, and *How it works* lists them under *Photo credits* with links to the licence and the source. Only files with a credits entry may be used; `scripts/curate-check.js` fails otherwise. To swap a photo, take a freely licensed Commons file, resize it with `sips --resampleWidth 640` to 60 KB or less, add its credits entry from the Commons API (author, licence short name, licence URL, file page) and point the deck item at `/curate/img/<file>`.

**Score → tier.** Names, rewards and pictures come from `config.js` `merch` by position (`free`, then `tiers[0..2]`); thresholds and rules live in `site/curate/settings.js`.

| Tier | Game route | Check-in route (unchanged) | Merch (today's `config.js`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Everyone | Finish a round | Visit the booth | Stickers and metallic tattoos |
| Teal | `tiers[1]` points (600: 6 right) | Check in | Kleros flip-flops |
| Purple | `tiers[2]` points (800: 8 right) | + Telegram, X and LinkedIn | Copper bottle or gamcha |
| Gold | `tiers[3]` points (1,000: a perfect round, 10 out of 10) | + Kleros 101 | Kleros kurta |

In badge mode a game tier above Everyone also needs the contact step (below); no check-in is needed. Without the sheet script (*Fallback* below) the old rule holds: every tier above Everyone needs a confirmed check-in on the same phone.

The thresholds (`tiers` in `site/curate/settings.js`: the ladder and copy read them from there) count right answers. A round scores 100 per right answer and 10 per wrong one, so the tiers follow the right answers exactly: Teal (600) is 6 right, Purple (800) 8 right and Gold (1,000) 10 out of 10, whatever the wrong ones add (5 right and 5 wrong is 550, still under Teal). A simulation of player profiles on the 10-entry, 90-second round with pick mode and no time bonus gives about 4.5% Everyone, 21.2% Teal, 50.2% Purple and 24% Gold scores (Gold is a perfect round, so it can't be made rarer without a harder round). Every simulated *Wrong* includes a pick: a player who rightly marks a fake Wrong taps the wrong part with a per-profile probability (from 95% for an expert to 50% for a novice), otherwise another one, and the pick adds about 0.8 s (it costs time but scores nothing). The sim models the tries too: at most 2 counted tries per player for the whole event, with 60% playing one and 40% playing two. A round deals 5 fakes so that blind tapping stays under Teal: marking everything Correct or everything Wrong is 5 right and 5 wrong, 550, and doing nothing scores 0, so none of them ever reaches Teal. A flawless round reaches Gold at a calm pace (always at 1.7 s, 98% at 6 s a decision). Random fast swiping (a coin flip for each entry, 5 right on average) reaches Teal in about 37.5% of rounds; `--sim` prints how often, but does not fail on it. `node scripts/curate-check.js --fit` prints thresholds fitted to those shares, and `--sim` checks them.

**Badge: 2 tries for the whole event.** The Devcon badge is the player's id: *scan your conference badge and start*. On the intro, **Scan your badge** opens a camera sheet (*Scan your Devcon badge*; the booth tablet uses its front camera, mirrored). If the camera won't read it, *Type the code* takes the code printed on the badge. Scanning spends nothing: the intro then shows *Badge …A1B2 · Try 1 of 2* and **Start**. **A try counts when Start is tapped** (the server spends it; quitting doesn't refund it), and each badge gets **2 counted tries for the whole event** (3–6 Nov; `countedTries` in `settings.js`, `TRIES_PER_BADGE` in `Code.gs`) on any phone, private tab or the booth tablet. It's 2 tries per ticket, not per day: a new day gives no new tries, and the *Day* column in *Tries* is only a record. The game says so on the title (*Your Devcon badge gives 2 tries for merch.*, then *1 of 2 tries left.* and *Both tries used. Play for fun.*), the intro, the Go banner (*Try 1 of 2 · Go!*), Results and the back of the ticket. The badge's **best counted score** (over all booth days) is saved on the badge list and decides its ticket. After both tries, or with no badge, rounds are *Just for fun · Go!*. *Not your badge?* forgets it and scans again. While Start waits for the badge list (*Checking your badge…*), *Pick another app* waits too; a counted start whose round never began (the reply came after the player left) is kept and played by the next Start, never spent twice. A code that isn't a badge (the booth poster's QR) shows *That’s not a Devcon badge code* and the camera keeps reading. A phone remembers the badge's hash and last 4 characters (never the code), so try 2 needs no second scan; the tablet remembers nothing. A typed made-up code only buys rounds that can't win merch, because the desk scans the real lanyard badge. `badge.pattern` in `settings.js` rejects codes that don't look like a badge; set it from `/staff/?test=1` on real badges ([calibration](apps-script/staff-desk/README.md)).

**The contact step** (no check-in needed for merch). After a counted round reaches Teal or better, the ticket shows its tier but stays **locked** (code `······`) until the player leaves an email or a @Telegram handle in one field: *Unlock your ticket. Leave your email or @Telegram for the Kleros newsletter. Needed for merch. Unsubscribe any time.*, an optional tick *Also tell me how to earn as a curator: Kleros pays curators $5,000+ every month.* and *Cooperative Kleros keeps it for the newsletter only. Privacy*. **Unlock** sends it to the separate contacts sheet; the badge list only gets a yes in its *Contact* column. One contact per badge. Under Teal, nobody is asked. A visitor who left can unlock later: scan the badge again and tap *Unlock my Purple ticket* on the intro (no try spent), or *Unlock →* on the title. Nothing typed is kept on the phone or the tablet. This replaces the old check-in rule and the *Earn for real* box.

**Cutoff: Switches.** The game owner pauses merch, or marks a tier sold out, from the *Switches* tab of the badge list (owner only; the **Kleros booth** menu does the same) ([how](apps-script/staff-desk/README.md#switches-pause-merch-mark-a-tier-sold-out)). The game follows within a minute. **Merch paused:** the chips above Everyone say *Paused*, the title and intro say *Merch is paused right now.* and offer *Play for fun*, Start spends no try, and a live ticket notes it. **A tier sold out:** its chip says *Gone today* and its score gets the next open tier's reward (*Kleros kurta: gone for today. Your Gold score gets a copper bottle or gamcha.*). `soldOut` in `settings.js` stays as a static fallback.

**Fallback: no sheet script yet.** Until `server.endpoint` in `settings.js` is set, the game keeps its v6 per-phone behaviour, so the booth never breaks: no badge, scanner, contact step or Switches; the intro shows only **Start**; 2 counted tries per phone for the whole event in the browser's storage (no new tries on a new day; a private tab starts afresh); every tier above Everyone needs a confirmed check-in on the same phone (`checkinNeededFrom: 1`, with the strip *Teal score. Check in (1 min) on this phone to claim Kleros flip-flops.*); staff hold the ticket code 2 s to mark it Collected; and the desk says *Not connected yet*. The new title, intro and Results lines show in both modes. Don't switch modes mid-event: phones would lose their tries and tickets.

**Merch desk (staff only).** `/staff/` gives one merch item per Devcon badge, whatever phone the visitor used: staff scan the badge on the lanyard and see red (already got merch) or green with what the game earned and whether the contact was given. Staff never open the badge list: checking a badge saves nothing, and only tapping an item adds a row. Setup, the staff key and the desk in detail: [`apps-script/staff-desk/README.md`](apps-script/staff-desk/README.md).

**The ticket** looks like the check-in ticket: tier colour, sheen, pulsing live dot, ticking clock and today's date. Tapping it turns it over (the try, its day and time, and the app on the back, for example *Try 2 of 2 · Tue 3 Nov · 14:32 · Travel guide app*; the fallback names the day only when the best round was on an earlier day, since tries last the whole event). In badge mode it shows the badge's best round: **locked** (tier shown, code hidden, the contact step under it, *Unlock it below.*), then **live** once unlocked (a game **C-** code, *820 pts · Badge …A1B2*, *Show your badge at the merch desk.*, *From your best round*), **Everyone** under Teal (stickers, no code), or **Collected** once the desk recorded an item. Staff use the desk, so the ticket has no stamp. In the fallback the code is the check-in's **K-** code when the visitor checked in on this phone, otherwise a C- code, and the ticket shows the higher of the game and check-in tiers (*Your merch comes with your check-in ticket* when the check-in's is at least as high; *Merch goes with your first check-in* for a check-in marked *Already claimed*).

**Staff card** (also printed and laminated for the booth):

1. Open **devcon.kleros.io/staff/** on your own phone (staff key needed; never on the kiosk tablet) and tap **Scan badge**. Scan only the badge on their lanyard, never a phone screen, a photo or paper. If the camera won't read it, type the code printed on the badge.
2. **Red, *Already got merch*:** this badge already got an item. Stickers only.
3. **Green, *New badge*:** the screen says what the game earned, for example *Game: Purple · 820 pts. Give up to Purple.* Tap the item you hand over (buttons up to the earned tier; paused or sold-out tiers are off) and hand it over only once the screen says ***Give: …***.
   - *…but no email or Telegram yet:* ask them to scan their badge in the game and tap **Unlock**, then tap **Check again**.
   - *No game score* or *under Teal:* stickers, unless they show a check-in ticket: type its **K-** code and read its colour (any open tier). If you use the check-in merch desk (devcon.kleros.io/admin), tick *Merch given* there too.
4. ***Can't reach the list***: hand over nothing, tap **Try again**.

Everyone (stickers and tattoos): just hand them over; there is nothing to scan.

In the fallback (no sheet script) the desk says *Not connected yet*: read the ticket instead (the clock ticks, the date is today, a tap turns it over; a frozen clock means a screenshot), then hold its code for 2 s and tap *Mark collected* (Undo for 5 s).

**Stock runbook.** The game shares the check-in's stock. The quick levers are the Switches (no deploy); the rest are in `site/curate/settings.js`:

| Situation | Change |
|---|---|
| Out of merch, or need a pause | *Switches* › untick **Merch open** (or **Kleros booth › Pause merch**) |
| Kurtas out for the day | *Switches* › tick **Gold sold out**; or `substitutes.gold` = PoH tee |
| More than half of today's ~25 kurtas gone by 14:00 | Nothing to raise: Gold (`tiers[3]`) is 1,000, a perfect round and the most a round scores. Hand out the rest, then tick **Gold sold out** (row above) |
| Flip-flops or bottles running low | Raise `tiers[1]`/`tiers[2]` by 100: one more right answer (Purple at most 900, under Gold) |
| Next morning | Untick, revert |

A sold-out tick stays on until you untick it. For `settings.js`, edit and deploy; after changing `tiers`, also paste `Code.gs` with the same `TIERS` and deploy a new version, and change the right answers in *How it works* (`site/curate/index.html`: *Teal at 6 right, Purple at 8*) and `RIGHT_FOR` in `scripts/curate-check.js` (the check fails when they differ). The `no-cache` header (`site/_headers`) means phones pick the change up on their next load. A sold-out tier drops game scores to the next open tier, and the ticket says so (*Kleros kurta: gone for today. Your Gold score gets a copper bottle or gamcha.*). A substitute is `{ reward, short, img: [...] }`, where `short` is how it reads mid-sentence, for example `substitutes.gold = { reward: 'PoH tee', short: 'a PoH tee', img: ['assets/merch/tee.jpg'] }`. In badge mode a ticket follows the badge's best score, recorded with the thresholds in force then (`soldOut` and the Switches apply at once). In the fallback, raised thresholds apply to new rounds and tickets already earned keep their tier. These levers change the game only, not the check-in tiers.

**Storage.** The game keeps little on the phone, in `localStorage`:

| Key | Mode | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `kleros_devcon_curate` | both | The entries seen last round; in the fallback also the phone's tries (for the whole event), best run, the last 12 runs and Collected |
| `kleros_devcon_curate_badge` | badge, own phone only | The badge's hash and last 4 characters (never the code), its last known state (best, contact, collected) for an offline ticket, and a score not saved yet (re-sent on the next load, up to 6 h) |
| `kleros_curate_desk` | desk | The staff key and first name on that staff phone |
| `kleros_devcon_self` | fallback, read only | The check-in on the same phone; never written by the game |

The retired `kleros_devcon_curate_earn` (the old *Earn for real* queue) is removed on load. An email or handle is never kept on any device. When storage is blocked the game still works.

**Kiosk mode.** `/curate/?kiosk=1` on a booth tablet, the same flag as the check-in. Nothing is read from or written to storage, and no link goes back to the check-in. In badge mode the intro always starts at *Scan your badge*; the scanned badge lives in memory for that visitor only, so their round counts fully (the badge is the identity, no tier cap), and the contact step runs on the tablet (no autocomplete, cleared on every show). *Next curator* resets everything 20 s after the ticket opens, but not while the ticket is locked or a score is still saving; 60 s idle on the intro, Results or a locked ticket also resets. A score still unsaved at a reset keeps retrying in the background. In the fallback a tablet round is capped at Teal (`kioskMaxTier`). The check-in's kiosk tablet hides the Play Curate card, because it resets after 12 s.

**No change to the check-in backend.** No change to `apps-script/Code.gs`, no new tab in the Booth Leads Database and no request to its backend (the game never posts to `config.js`'s endpoint): game scores are not in that Sheet or the dashboard. The only outside requests are the Google Fonts the check-in already uses and, in badge mode, the game owner's own sheet script (`apps-script/staff-desk/`: badge tries, contacts, Switches, the desk). It writes two sheets of its own, kept apart: the badge list and the newsletter contacts. `?lite=1` forces the flat 2D Results medal (no WebGL), which is also the automatic fallback. The photos are served from `site/curate/img/` on the same domain; the only links to other sites are the Kleros docs link and the photo credits.

**Checks.** Run `node scripts/curate-check.js` after editing anything in `site/curate/`, `site/staff/` or `apps-script/staff-desk/Code.gs`. It validates the three decks (unique ids, 4 parts per entry with the picture first, every fake has exactly one odd part, its fix and a why of 48 characters or fewer for the red flash, no links or markup, the intro's correct and wrong example, flags of a known kind (including `h4` and `h5`), painted logo specs with an allowed mark, every photo file exists in `site/curate/img/` and has a credits entry), checks the copy for banned job words, for web3 words (allowed only in the Tokens deck's own data and the crypto card) and for Curate jargon on the play screen (challenge, verify, listed, jurors, bounty, deposit, stake, pending, submitted and the like, scanned in `game.js` toast and flash strings) and for tries limited by the day (*tries a day*, *tomorrow*, *new tries*, and any *today* or *a day* in the game's own strings, even a fragment such as `' left'`, except stock lines like *Gone today* and the deck data: tries are per badge for the whole event), builds 2,000 rounds of each deck to check the deck order rules (fakes per round, each photo once, easy start), reports file sizes (photos are left out of the eager budget and reported as a total; `credits.js` has a larger budget now that it lists twice the photos; jsQR is lazy and reported apart), and lints `site/curate/*.js`, `desk.js` and `Code.gs` for ES5. It also runs `Code.gs` against stubbed Sheets (setup, `TIERS`, `TRIES_PER_BADGE` and `MAX_SCORE` in sync with `settings.js`, 2 tries per badge with a third start refused and no new tries on a new day, the *Day* record and the desk's handouts today on the Mumbai day, finish limits, contacts, claims, switches, caps), the Results and ticket cases in both modes (scan, 2 tries, the Go banner and Results line for each try, none back at 00:01 Mumbai time or on the last booth day, the ticket back naming the day of a best round from another day, locked ticket and contact, lost replies, paused, kiosk) and `badge.js` (ids, salt, script order). It ends with a short manual QA list for real devices. `node scripts/curate-check.js --sim` also reruns the tier calibration (with the 2 counted tries) and prints the tier shares and random swiping's Teal share; it fails if lazy play ever reaches Teal or the shares drift more than 4 points from the ones above.

**Testing before opening.** The checks don't replace a run on the real deployment. The full step-by-step guide (the deployment, the 2 tries on one badge across phones and days, the desk, Switches, the kiosk tablet, a bad connection, the fallback and the clean-up) is in [`apps-script/staff-desk/README.md`](apps-script/staff-desk/README.md#test-it-step-by-step-before-opening). Use made-up codes such as `TEST0001`, and delete the test rows afterwards: a row left in *Tries* keeps that badge's tries spent for the whole event.

## The Sheet

`setup` builds: **Read me**, **Leads** (one row per person, 7 colour-coded column groups, pre-sized for 10,000 rows; the last group, *Merch tier*, holds tier, claim, Telegram check and steps), **Priority queue**, **By pipeline**, **By level**, **Flags**, **Research queue**, **Dashboard**, **Agent log**. The stacked views show each section's best 100 with a full count. A **Kleros** menu re-runs matching, rebuilds views, shows the key, and loads or deletes the three fictional `EX-` example rows (delete them before Devcon).

Visitor text is written as plain text (anything starting with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@` can't run as a formula; the CSV export is protected the same way). Times are in Asia/Kolkata. The same email checking in twice is flagged **Returning visitor**.

## Matching

`site/matching.js`: 11 Kleros tracks with keywords, products and owners. `focus: true` marks this year's pipelines (AI agents, prediction markets, enterprise, DeFi curation): big cards on the form, dashboard tiles, and the only tracks that can be **Hot**. Level comes from job level (counted double) plus role: Decision-maker / Influencer / Practitioner / Community. Interest labels match regardless of case. Avoid everyday words as keywords ("chain" matches "blockchain").

After changing it: redeploy the site and the backend, then Sheet menu *Kleros › Re-run use-case matching*.

## What updates by itself

| Change | Shows up how |
|---|---|
| Check-ins, Sheet edits, team notes, research | Instantly; the dashboard re-reads every minute |
| `site/` | On the next Netlify deploy (a push, once the repo is connected) |
| `site/curate/settings.js` (stock levers) | On the next deploy; phones pick it up on their next load (`no-cache`) |
| `apps-script/` | Only after pasting the bundle and deploying a new version |
| The game's *Switches* tab (merch open, sold out) | Within a minute, no deploy |
| `apps-script/staff-desk/Code.gs` | Only after pasting it into the badge list's script and deploying a new version (same URL) |

## New Devcon year

1. `site/config.js`: `edition`, `city`, `event`, Community Hubs.
2. `site/matching.js`: move `focus: true` to that year's pipelines; adjust keywords.
3. `site/curate/decks.js`: the game's content is per edition. Swap the six Mumbai sights (and, if the host country changes, the other India sights) for the new host's (photos in `site/curate/img/` with their `credits.js` entries, see *Photos and credits*), re-check every sight, country and token entry (cities, capitals, web domains and official token websites change rarely, but check), then run `node scripts/curate-check.js --sim`. For badge play: fresh badge and contacts sheets (`apps-script/staff-desk/README.md`), and recalibrate `badge.pattern` on the new badges.
4. A fresh Sheet (new Apps Script project, "From scratch") or keep one and filter on **Event**.
5. Redeploy. The QR codes stay the same.

## Booth QR codes

`python3 qr/make_qr.py` regenerates the booth poster (6×8 in, plus an A4 PNG and print-ready PDF), square sticker and plain PNG/SVG for https://devcon.kleros.io, and checks each one scans (OpenCV and ZXing; needs `qrcode[pil]`, `opencv-python-headless`, `zxing-cpp`). Keep the finder-eye corners small (`EYE_R`) so every scanner finds the code.

The Curate game has its own poster set, written beside the check-in one without touching it (keep the trailing slash in the address):

```bash
python3 qr/make_qr.py https://devcon.kleros.io/curate/ --name=curate-kleros-qr --headline="Play Kleros Curate" --perk="Help an app clean its list in 90 s, win merch"
```

It writes `curate-kleros-qr-poster.png`, `curate-kleros-qr-poster-a4.png` and `.pdf`, `curate-kleros-qr-square.png`, `curate-kleros-qr-plain.png` and `curate-kleros-qr-plain.svg` (QR version 4 at ECC H), and runs the same scan check. `--name=` sets the file prefix (lower-case letters, digits and `-`), `--headline=` and `--perk=` the two top lines. Without these flags the script writes the check-in set exactly as before. The game posters are in `qr/` (made on 29 Oct with Pillow 11.3, OpenCV 5.0 and zxing-cpp 2.2, the newest zxing-cpp with a ready-made wheel for macOS Python 3.9; made again on 2 Nov with the perk changed to 90 s). Both times ZXing read every one at every size, but the URL is longer than the check-in's, so the denser code made OpenCV, the pickier decoder, miss some sizes: the script reported `NO SCAN` for the A4 poster at OpenCV 2/4 (2 Nov: poster OpenCV 3/4, ZXing 4/4; A4 OpenCV 2/4, ZXing 4/4). Test-scan the A4 print with a few iOS and Android phones before printing a batch. Never regenerate the check-in posters just for this.

## Privacy

The page carries its own privacy notice (controller: Cooperative Kleros; purposes include public-profile research; deletion on request). The blog box is never pre-ticked.

The Curate game has its own short notice (*Privacy* in the fine print and under the contact step, an in-page section, so it also works on the tablet): an email or @Telegram left to unlock merch goes to a private list for the Kleros newsletter (and curator info only if ticked), a Telegram handle gets one message with the newsletter channel link, and it is kept until unsubscribe or deletion (ask at the booth or write to `contact.privacyEmail` in `settings.js`, today fortunato@kleros.io). The badge is stored only as a salted hash, on the badge list, never next to a contact; the contacts sheet holds no badge, score, token or time of day. No analytics. Without the sheet script the game sends nothing: scores, tries and the ticket stay on the phone, and it reads the check-in saved on the same phone (name, K- code, tier) without changing it. The newsletter import should use double opt-in.
